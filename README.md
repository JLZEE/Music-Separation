# Music-Separation
This project tackles the problem of separating the melodies of 
different musical instruments from a piece of music with no vocal 
sound. The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used as the main 
tool during the whole process, and three methods are used for pitch 
detection. A piece of Chinese classical music which consists of two 
musical instruments is used as original data, and the melodies of the 
two musical instruments are eventually separated from each other. 
The quality of the main melody which is played by one instrument is 
guaranteed after separation, with no background sound included.
